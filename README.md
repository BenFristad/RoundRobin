# RoundRobin
This program uses round robin process scheduling by using a Doubly Circular Linked List.

BEFORE RUNNING PROGRAM:

The program takes 2 arguments. It takes a text file as arg[0] and a integer as arg[1]. The text file needs to be formatted as exactly (process ID, time required to finish process)

Reference data.txt to see the format of the file.

The second argument is an int that reprents how much time is taken off of each process as we iterate through the linked list.

The output of this program will a list of the processes in the order that they were completed.
